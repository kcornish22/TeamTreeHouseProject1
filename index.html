        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I’m an aspiring web designer who's currently in college for mathematics and computer science. The ability to
          create has always been in my blood since I was born. My passion for the arts then turned into my passion for coding 
          starting from when I was in a Girl Scout computer science camp that focused on inspiring young women in STEM. When it 
          was time to declare a major in college I knew computer science and everything within it was for me. Coding is an artistic
          profession that I want to be a part of.
